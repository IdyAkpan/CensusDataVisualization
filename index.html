	<h1> Gender Pay Inequality & Work in America </h1>
	<h3> The United States, like many countries in the world, has a gender problem. It can't seem to figure out how to pay its women workers the same as its men. According to the Pew Research Center, the gap is narrowing; it's gone from $0.64 in 1980 to $0.83 in 2017*. However, I was curious to see how this varied by field. If everyone completed this course and became a software engineer, there would be a $1: $0.86 discrepancy in pay, simply due to gender. This is on par with the discrepancy for bartenders and even maids/house cleaners (a women dominated field). Fascinating, huh? <br>
	Construction appears to be a surprisingly equitable playing field with women making $1.01 for every male dollar, as are nursing and counseling fields. </h3>
